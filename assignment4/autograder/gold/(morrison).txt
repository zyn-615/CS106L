124 WAS SPITEFUL. Full of a <<baby's>> venom. The women in the house knew 
it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his 
own way, but by 1873 <<Sethe>> and her daughter Denver were its only victims.
The grandmother, Baby <<Suggs>>, was dead, and the sons, Howard and <<Buglar>>, 
had run away by the time they were thirteen years old--as soon as merely
looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for <<Buglar>>); as soon
as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither 
boy waited to see more; another kettleful of chickpeas smoking in a heap on 
the floor; soda crackers crumbled and strewn in a line next to the door sill.
