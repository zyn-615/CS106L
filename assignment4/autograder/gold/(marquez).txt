Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel <<Aureliano>> Buend√≠a
was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.

At that time Macondo was a <<vilage>> of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank
of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of <<pollished>> stones, which were
white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many
things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was <<necesary>> to point.

Aureliano: {aurelian}
vilage: {milage, pilage, silage, viage, village, vinage, visage, volage}
